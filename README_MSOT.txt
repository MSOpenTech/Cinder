Notes for Cinder/XAML2 branch status as of 1/23/2014:

This branch contains a version of Cinder that has been
upgraded to VC2013 for WinRT and also has been
modified to work with XAML.

This branch is now somewhat stable: bug fixes only.

Please see the file in src/cinder/winrt/XAML/readme.txt
for additional information.

note:
Project files have not been checked for Release mode settings.
It is recommended to compare them to the latest out-of-the-box
Cinder release config for reference (at VC2012).
